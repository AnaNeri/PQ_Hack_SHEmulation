*** Part 1 ***

> A
 

> B
We started with two qubits, one encodes sin(x + phi) while the other encodes sin(2x+phi). 
The predition presented the expected shape with shifted amplitudes. 
So one adds a constants C to the observable to get good prediction.
Consequently, the expected values of phi1 and phi2.

> C
In this case one need to change the feature map to 2*x.

*** Part 2 ***
> A
Similar to 1C, but instead of one value C one need two values. 

> B

> C
